# CNweather

This is a new project for me to learn spatial analysis, learn what sites built in R are capable of, and to test R's ability to digest dynamic information. The end goal (if possible) will be a Shiny site that gives realtime or near-realtime weather reports for the Choctaw Nation in SE Oklahoma.
